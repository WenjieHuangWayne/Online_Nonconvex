Data and Code for manuscript "Online Non-convex Optimization with Long-term Non-convex Constraints" https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02426

Data is generated through "DataGenerate.m".

The ADE model is modelled by "ade_model.m".

The codes for baseline algorithm are "OPMM.m" and "Algorithm_1_Agarwal_19.m".

The main code for the proposed algorithm is "Main_code_500_offline_oracles.m", and the out-of-sample test is conducted through "Out-of-sample_performance_evauation.m".
